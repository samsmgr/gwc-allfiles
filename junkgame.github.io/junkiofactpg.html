      <p> Hello. Welcome to 2019. Our world is in danger and we need your help. A  few days ago, my Beluga Whale friend, Billy, was found dead with 13 pounds of plastic in his stomach. It is all because of YOU. Every day we are hit with the 8 million pieces of plastic you dump in our home. It kills over 1,000,000 of my seabird friends. Out of all the garbage in my home, approximately 80% of it is plastic. Please help me and my friends. We cannot do this without you :( </p>
